Smoosh (the Symbolic, Mechanized, Observable, Operational SHell) is a formalization of the [POSIX shell standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/contents.html).

Smoosh is written in a mix of [Lem](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/lem/) and OCaml, using [libdash](https://github.com/mgree/libdash) to parse shell code.
