# Model

## Setup

you need a symlink to lem/ocaml-lib in this directory under the name ocaml-lib

## TODO

Field Splitting should only happen after a full "stage 1" expansion
- Concat a list of strings created from fully\_expand\_words
- So then field splitting happens on a string
- returns a list of strings (each string is a field)
